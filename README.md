* **image** folder contains the image of the exploded view in this README file.
* **cad_files** contains all the files needed to manufacture the docking platform,
as well as additional files for reference. This will be explained further below.
* **assembly_process.docx** is a word document outlining the assembly process

## CAD Files
There are four folders within this directory:
1. **Docking Platform** - These are all the parts needed to manufacture the docking platform.
2. **Electronics** - These are reference CAD files of the electronic components used in the project that correspond to their physical counterparts. They are used for computer-aided assembly only and *do not need to be manufactured*.
3. **Gears** - The gears used for the project. Needs to be manufactured.
4. **Rover** - Reference CAD files of the rover to ensure the platform fits on the rover. *Does not need to be manufactured*.
